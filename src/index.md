# Speedscanner â€” Automated frontend website performance monitoring

Synthetic web page testing testing tools like [Google Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) and [WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) can provide incredibly useful insight into the performance of websites for any web developer. Despite a huge number of backend performance monitoring tools, there are few frontend performance monitoring tools. Among several others, [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com/) and [Calibre](https://calibreapp.com/) provide this service but can prove to be expensive and over-complicated.

Until recently, [SpeedTracker](https://speedtracker.org/) offered a free open-source alternative, however from late-2019 it seems to no longer function and is no longer maintained. Speedscanner is heavily inspired by SpeedTracker but relies on free [serverless](https://serverless.css-tricks.com/) functions rather than a central server in order to be totally disconnected and within complete control of developers.

Whatever your need, SpeedScanner can help you easily monitor the performance of websites for free.
